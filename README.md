# tic-tac-toe
this project is incomplete and abandoned.

## idea:
1. create an API for tic-tac-toe.
2. develop a front-end that uses the API to play tic tac toe.
3. makes game accessible for visually impaired individuals to play too for adding option to play the game using keybinds and voiceover to notify them on changes of the board and assist them with making them moves.
